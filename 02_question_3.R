# Question 3:  What is the probability of an edge forming between a particular student and orchestra?
# Probably have to change this question to be more ERGM-oriented.
# Other ideas for question #:
# Test Hypothesis: if you go to a "top" school youâ€™re more likely to participate in one of the top three festivals 
# Award/festival participants are more likely to be in major orchestras than those who are not award/festival participants

# gonna try the "top" school and festival performance
# if else?
